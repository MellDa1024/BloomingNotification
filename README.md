# BloomingNotification
Notice 3 times on 14, 44 minutes to prepare Blooming Forest Event.

Works only when the website is open.

## This program requires:
1. Node.js

## Installing
1. Make folder
2. Copy and paste the project file to folder that you created on No.1
3. open cmd, cd to folder, and type node server.js
4. go to localhost:8888<br />
Why localhost? : because notification doesn't work without server(maybe?)

Actually I don't know about javascript and node and html well, I've just googled it.


When notification doesn't work while playing game:

Disable Focus Assist in Win10 Settings.
