HOTO(Maybe?) :
1. Make Dir and cd <br />
2. npm init <br />
3. copy and paste the project file to Dir<br />
4. node server.js <br />
5. go to localhost:8888 <br />
Why localhost? : because notification doesn't work without server(maybe?)

Actually I have no idea about javascript and node and html, I've just googled and attached it.<br /><br />
When notification doesn't work while playing game:<br />
Check Focus Assist in Win10 Settings. <br />
