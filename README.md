# BloomingNotification
Notice 3 times on 14, 44 minutes to prepare Blooming Forest Event.

Works only when the website is open.

## Before Installing
Needs Node.js and npm

## Installing
1. Make Dir and cd
2. npm init
3. copy and paste the project file to Dir
4. node server.js
5. go to localhost:8888<br />
Why localhost? : because notification doesn't work without server(maybe?)

Actually I don't know about javascript and node and html well, I've just googled it.

When notification doesn't work while playing game:

Check Focus Assist in Win10 Settings.
